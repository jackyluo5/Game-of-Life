/*==================================================
 * RULES:   For a space that is 'populated':
            -We define each cell to have eight neighbor cells.
             -The neighbors of a cell are the cells directly above, below, to the right, 
              to the left, diagonally above to the right and left, and diagonally 
              below to the right and left.
            -Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
            -Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
            -Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
            -For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
            -Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
            
            -Births and deaths are instantaneous and occur at the changes of generation.
             A cell dying for whatever reason may help cause birth, but a
             newborn cell cannot resurrect a cell that is dying, nor will a cellâ€™s death
             prevent the death of another, say, by reducing the local population.

 * CONTROLS: [NUM1]: SAVE, [NUM2]: LOAD, [S]: iterate one, [G]: run continuously, [C]: clear, [R]: randomize, [ESC]: close
 * BOXES ON RIGHT:  FIRST BOX = [G], SECOND BOX = [R], THIRD BOX = [C], FOURTH BOX: [NUM1], FIFTH BOX: [NUM2],  [ESC]: close
 *
 * FUNCTIONS: init, print, setAlive, kill, isAlive, countNeighbors, step, random, randomize, save, load,
 * CLASS: game. Private variables = real[MAX][MAX], load[MAX][MAX]
 * SFML: ProccessEvents, FillShapes, ShowShapes, Boxes
 * =================================================
 *
 * Process:
 * I started with the basic knowledge of classes and creating the code necessary for the neighbors function.
 * I started with a basic set alive, is alive, and kill function
 * Then with that, I could make my functions of the neighbors and the step function.
 * I drew everything out to understand it more in depth and helped me write the main functions
 * Once I had all my functions, I made a class and moved my arguments that contained arrays into a global variable
 * I also set constants and the variables needed for sfml
 * Once I've tested all my functions and everything works fine, I slowly moved everything onto sfml
 * I got the windows and the grid and the setup all working and it's based on coordinates
 * I put everything together and it works exactly how the game of life should.
